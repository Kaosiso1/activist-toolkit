          The relentless degradation and unjust treatment on black women and
          girls have been occuring since the times of slavery. And it's sad to
          say things have not changed, America shifted its form of expolitation
          of African American women from slavery, to films, social media, and
          everday life. We all remember those events in middle/elementary school
          where a black girl was bullied for having kinky hair and ebony skin,
          and if you were one of those people to insult her appearance, shame on
          you! Those same innocent, little girls grow up to have self-hate
          issues and take on the mindset that they belong in this "angry,
          strong, warrior" trope and hide our vulnerability, because apparently
          it's all their good for. Malcolm X said, “The most disrespected woman
          in America, is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America
          is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black
          woman.” He quoted this in 1962, it's 2020. Let's take the steps to
          discredit it. &#128420;
